#Problem 2
```{r }
#(a) Read the input file into a variable and print its first lines of data using the command head.
micron <- read.csv('MU.csv', header=TRUE)
micron$Date <- as.Date(micron$Date, "%m/%d/%y")
head(micron)

#(b) Plot the daily close prices
plot(micron$Date, micron$Adj.Close, main='MU Daily Close Prices 2017', xlab='Date', ylab='Adjusted Close', pch=20)

#(c) Compute the corresponding series of log-returns. Make another plot and report the summary statistics using the command summary.
micron["Returns"] <- NA
i <- 1
while(i <= length(micron$Adj.Close)){
  if(i==1){
    micron$Returns[i] <- NA
  }else{
    micron$Returns[i] <- log(micron$Adj.Close[i])-log(micron$Adj.Close[i-1])
  }
  i <- i+1
}
plot(micron$Date, micron$Returns, main='MU Daily Log Returns 2017', xlab='Date', ylab='Return', pch=20)
summary(micron$Returns)

#(d) Do a box plot of the log-returns and verify if there are any outliers.
boxplot(micron$Returns, main='MU Daily Log Returns 2017', ylab='Returns', pch=20)
#Since there are a few points outside of the plot, it means that we have outliers in the returns in both the positive and negative direction

#(e) Do a normal qqplot with the log-returns series and comment your resuts.
qqnorm(micron$Returns)
#Since the data points fall along a straight, ascending line on the normal qqplot, with a majority of the points in the interval [-1,1], it would be a safe assumption to say the log-returns of Micron are normally distributed
