## Assume you have a geometric distribution X ~ Ge(0.3)


```{r}
#1 Generate 1000 random numbers from geometric distribution with p = 0.3
x <- rgeom(1000, 0.3)

#2 Make a histogram for the random numbers
hist(x, ylim=c(0,1), freq=F)

#3 Make a density plot based on the true distribution
plot(x=seq(0,max(x)), y = dgeom(seq(0,max(x)), 0.3), type = "l" )

#4 Make a CDF plot based on the true distribution
y <- seq(-1,(max(x)+1), by=0.01)
plot(y, pgeom(y,0.3))

```
