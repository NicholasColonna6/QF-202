#Assuming the number of phone call arriving to a switching board is distributed according to a  Poisson distribution with the parameter lambda equaling 3 calls/minutes. Suppose I observe the switching board for 10 minutes. We want to investigate the probability that there exists an inter-arrival time greater than a time interval denoted t. To estimate this, follow the steps:

```{r }
#1. Draw a random number k from the Poisson distribution corresponding to the 10 minute interval.
k <- rpois(1,30)
k


#2. Draw k random numbers from the Uniform distribution U(0, 10) - these are the arrival times for those k events.
randomNums <- runif(k,0,10)
randomNums


#3. Sort the random times in step 2 from low to high.
sortedNums <- sort(randomNums)
sortedNums


#4. Create a function that will take as input the arrival times from 3 and will output the smallest and the largest time interval between these consecutive arrivals. 
intervals <- vector()
i <- 1
while(i <= length(sortedNums)){
  if(i==1){
    intervals[i] <- sortedNums[i]
  }else{
    intervals[i] <- sortedNums[i] - sortedNums[i-1]
  }
  i <- i + 1
}
intervals #Intervals
max(intervals) #Largest Inverval 
min(intervals) #Smallest Interval


#5. Apply the function for 10,000 generated sequences. Create a histogram for each the smallest inter-arrival time and the largest inter-arrival time. What is the estimate for the expected smallest inter-arrival and largest inter-arrival. (Hint: How do one estimates expectations?)
minVals <- vector()
maxVals <- vector()
test1 <- 0  #Counts all values that are less than 0.3
test2 <- 0  #Counts all values that are not greater than 0.5

for(i in 1:10000){
  large.random <- sort(runif(k,0,10))
  large.intervals <- vector()
  j <- 1
  while(j <= length(large.random)){
    if(j==1){
      large.intervals[j] <- large.random[j]
    }else{
      large.intervals[j] <- large.random[j] - large.random[j-1]
    }
    
    if(large.intervals[j] < 0.3){
      test1 <- test1 + 1
    }
    if(large.intervals[j] <= 0.05){
      test2 <- test2 + 1
    }
    j <- j+1
  }
  
  minVals[i] <- min(large.intervals)
  maxVals[i] <- max(large.intervals)
}

mean(minVals)  #Estimate for expected smallest interval
hist(minVals)

mean(maxVals)  #Estimate for expected largetst interval
hist(maxVals)


#6. Based on your results what is the probability that at least one inter-arrival time is greater than 0.3? What is the probability that all inter-arrival times are greater than 0.05.

p1 <- 1 - (test1) / (k*10000)
p1

p2 <- 1- (test2) / (k*10000)
p2



```
