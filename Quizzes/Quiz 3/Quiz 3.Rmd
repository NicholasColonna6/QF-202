```{r }
#Generate 1,000 random numbers from NB(3; 0.2). 
x <- rnbinom(1000, 3, 0.2)

#Calculate sample mean based on the previous random numbers.
sampleMean <- mean(x)
sampleMean
#Calculate sample deviation based on the previous random numbers
sampleDeviation <- sqrt(var(x))
sampleDeviation

#Calculating theoretical mean
theoreticalMean <- 3 * (1-0.2) / 0.2
theoreticalMean

#Calculating theoretical standard deviation
theoreticalDeviation <- sqrt((3 * (1-0.2)) / (0.2)^2)
theoreticalDeviation

#Create a table to record your answers.
